The tremolo features rate, depth and gain control. With most tremolo effects, overall volume loss is inevitable, so a gain knob is necessary to maintain consistency in your signal chain.

There are two selectable waveshapes that source the tremolo, namely Square and Triangular. The rate knob allows you to sweep frequency of the Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) that drives the effect from ~0.5Hz to ~16Hz.

The depth control gives you flexibility with how intense the effect is. If you don't want full volume drop ~-3dB, you can reduce the effect all the way up to no volume drop, allowing you full control over how you would like your guitar to sound.
