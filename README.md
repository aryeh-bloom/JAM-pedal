The goal is to have 2 analog circuits, namely a tremolo and a phaser, both powered by a simple LFO
There will also be 2 digital circuits (an echo and a delay) that will be controlled by a raspberry pi zero
The footswitch on the right will swap between the two analog/digital architectures, and the hand switch underneath the control dials will swap between each of their two respective effects, with a three way switch capable of outputting both effects simultaneously.
